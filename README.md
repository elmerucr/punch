![icon](./docs/punch_icon_80x80.png)

Punch is a virtual computer system that draws inspiration from iconic computing platforms such as the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, and Atari ST. Notable features include:

* Utilization of the MC6809 CPU using the [MC6809](https://github.com/elmerucr/MC6809) library
* A total of 16MB of video RAM, 64KB directly accessible by the CPU
* Screen resolution of 320x200 pixels, refresh rate of 60Hz
* Blitter chip for fast graphics processing
* Programmable using either MC6809 assembly or the Squirrel Programming Language

### Addressable by Blitter only

* ```$010000-$ffffff``` available vram (16.320kb) of which:
* ```$fe0000-$fee0ff``` default framebuffer vram (57.600 bytes)

## Building with CMake

Create a build directory in the source tree ```mkdir build```, run ```cmake ..``` from that directory and run ```make```. Alternatively do ```mkdir Debug```, run ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..``` from that directory and run ```make```.

Below some more OS specific intructions on how to prepare the build environment.

### MacOS specific

* Install Xcode from App Store
* When it asks to install command line tools, do that
* Install Homebrew
* From the Homebrew command line, install cmake and SDL2 libraries

### Ubuntu / Debian specific

To be done
