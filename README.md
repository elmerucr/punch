# punch

![icon](./docs/punch_icon_80x80.png)

Punch is a virtual computer system that draws inspiration from iconic computing platforms such as the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, and Atari ST. Notable features include:

* Utilization of the MC6809 CPU using the [MC6809](https://github.com/elmerucr/MC6809) library
* A total of 16MB of video RAM, 64KB directly accessible by the CPU
* Screen resolution of 320x180 pixels, refresh rate of 60Hz
* Blitter chip for fast graphics processing
